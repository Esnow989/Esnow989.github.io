        <h1>Sloths on Mars - Elise Snow</h1>
        <h2>The Senior Project from Senior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Senior Spanish major that loves sloths and space. I made this website for my Tec 101 Class and Bob Jones Unviversity.</p>
         <p>
            I hope you enjoy the great gif of this sloth. Hopefully I did that right. I am graduating in May of this year and will continue my deep passion for sloths, but mostly be studying at BJU Seminary for Intercultural Studies.
         </p> 
         <p>
            You can find me curating my personal library, drawing, petting my cat and wishing I had a sloth. Doing very hisptery grandma things basically. If you could see my mind it is Kabelsalat of Spanish, German and English.
